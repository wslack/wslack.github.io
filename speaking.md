I love giving talks about working in public, the civic tech space, better technical practices in running government systems, and better hiring practices in the public sphere. I routinely give talks, appear on panels, and speak to conferences, and have guested in classes for Georgetown, LBJ School of Public Affairs and Williams College.

Below are a few recent talks I've given. If you'd like to have me speak or run a workshop, please [contact me](/contact).
