	<p>I am serving a term appointment at the <a href="https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/">U.S. Digital Corps</a>, a unit of the U.S. government bringing in early-career technologists for two year fellowships at many federal agencies to improve our public capacity to leverage technology for stronger delivery. I previously served at <a href="https://usds.gov/">USDS</a> and <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> after time in industry.</p>

	<p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time singing, reading, and ideating on how technology will impact our lives in the future.</p>
