	<p>I recently served a term appointment at <a href="https://usds.gov/">USDS</a>, a startup within the U.S. government that partners leading technologists with dedicated public servants to improve the usability and reliability of our government's most important digital services. After a break, I will continue in a different government term role.</p>
