This post seeks to contrast USDS, 18F, and the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program using public information, leveraging my experience working at 18F alongside PIFs and later at USDS. I won't cover the the many wonderful shared aspects of the programs, but briefly, all three have staff appointed to term-limited positions, share a common goal of improving federal government tech capacity, and seek to elevate and empower career civil servant partners.

I should also mention two organizations doing related digital work: [Technology Transformation Services (TTS) Solutions](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/tts-solutions), which manages a variety of programs such as [usa.gov](https://usa.gov), [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov), [data.gov](https://data.gov), and [login.gov](https://login.gov), is mainly composed of career civil servants, and the [TTS Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/), which is set up in portfolios like AI and IT Infrastructure Optimization. These organizations have all changed under Obama and Trump administration, and while I have no inside information, there will likely be more change during the Biden administration.

To be clear and explicit: **this is my personal take** and based entirely on public information. My work here has been mostly to draw everything together in one place.

### Location

USDS and PIF hire for in-person roles in DC during non-pandemic times. 18F is remote-first and [has blogged on best practices for distributed teams](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/).

### Funding

USDS is *appropriated*, meaning that Congress budgets money for USDS staff in law, as is the case for most civil servants. 18F and PIF are funded by partner agencies that pay 18F and PIF for their services. (Without budgeted funding, they cannot legally work for free and need a formal mechanism to "recover costs.") The implications of this key difference drive many of the details below.

### Engagement style

USDS deploys teams into agencies to sit alongside partners; current feds will recognize a resemblance to a *detail* arrangement. USDSers work on projects aligning with their skillset and the required skills can change during a project's lifetime, such that the starting team can be very different from the team ending the engagement. Pre-pandemic, USDSers commuted to agencies around the DC area, including two near Baltimore (you won't have to go to Baltimore, but working on Medicare made it worth it for me!).

18F teams work a similar timeframe as USDS teams (people may join/leave projects as needs change), but they don’t typically get deployed into an agency the same way. For example, with full backend access to agency e-mail & systems. 18F is more like a consultancy model.

PIFs are embedded within federal agencies as “entrepreneurs in residence” for 12 months, with the opportunity to extend for a total of 2 years. Unlike USDS and 18F’s regular hiring, PIF is a fellowship that recruits annual cohorts of 20-30 fellows. Some PIF projects span fellows and cohorts (i.e. VA software portfolio to deliver veterans’ benefits faster); others are fellow-specific (i.e. global entrepreneurship program to fight poverty with Millennium Challenge Corporation).

### Parent agency

USDS is based in the [Executive Office of the President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/executive-office-of-the-president/), specifically in the [Office of Management and Budget (OMB)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/), which oversees executive branch agencies and assembles the yearly budget request for Congress’s consideration. Being part of "The White House" can make USDS seem intimidating, though it can also open doors. USDS's office is in a [converted 1870s town house](https://www.federaltimes.com/it-networks/2018/07/25/inside-the-agency-where-you-wish-you-worked/) once briefly occupied by President Theodore Roosevelt.

18F and PIF are based in the General Services Administration, a support agency for the executive branch (for example, it manages most federal real estate and manages large contract vehicles). 18F and PIF have hoteled office space in GSA's headquarters a block from the White House at 1800 F street (the [origin of 18F's name](https://18f.gsa.gov/about/#history-and-funding)).

### How their approaches complement each other

When you combine the differences above, each organization ends up with unique benefits and access by virtue of their different approaches and methodologies.

- Thanks to its EOP ties, USDS has unique access to presidential priorities or sensitive Cabinet level programs, and being appropriated means it can spin up on projects immediately.
- Thanks to its GSA ties, 18F can work with teams in the legistlative and judicial branches, as well as with independent regulatory agencies that keep at arm's length from the White House like the Federal Election Commission. Bluntly, GSA has a distance and boring-ness that allows 18F to avoid a perception of executive encroachment on other branches.
- Thanks to their "in residence" nature, PIFs can flexibly jump to other projects within their host agencies in a more "free agent" style over the course of their terms.

### Collaboration tools and tech

USDS often works with agencies just getting started with cloud tooling such as Microsoft Teams, so a USDSer enjoys all of the same frustrations as their career civil servant partners when trying to collaborate on a document or access shared information. GSA uses GSuite across its enterprise (the GSA IT team made the agency a [first-mover to cloud email](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-becomes-first-federal-agency-to-move-email-to-the-cloud-agencywide) in 2010), so 18F and PIF teams enjoy real-time collaboration on documents with anyone at GSA. Like USDS, PIF teams get equipment and e-mail addresses from the agencies where they are deployed - there can be significant friction if you try to work with one agency using a laptop from a different agency.

### Engagement incubation

USDS’s appropriation allows it to jump into supporting an agency on a problem immediately, though work often starts with a [discovery sprint](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/government-discovery-sprint-playbook-how-lessons-learned-kathy-pham/). 18F sets up a formal agreement before working on an engagement, which requires signoff from multiple partner officials and in my experience, usually took over a month to execute. PIFs are deployed to agencies annually, and agencies submit projects for PIFs months in advance to be considered for that year’s class of fellows under a similar agreement to 18F's. It’s also common for PIFs to flex to other special projects once they start at an agency, based on needs that come up throughout the year.

### How projects are chosen

There is an abundance of non-partisan digital problems to work on; you will never be bored with any of these groups. USDS selects projects aligning with its mission: to do [the greatest good, for the greatest number, with the greatest need](https://www.usds.gov/mission). 18F selects its work from the proposals it gets from possible partners, according to impact and skill fit. PIF works with its agency partners to identify projects of critical agency and/or national priority, and fellows also have the ability to work on their own special/collaborative projects during their tour.

### Roles

USDS and 18F technical staff generally join an acquisition, design, engineering, or product-focused community of peers. USDS team members have widely varying backgrounds and skillsets; [each community](https://www.usds.gov/how-we-work) is very diverse. 18F tends to seek [more specific skillsets](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/join/consulting-software-engineer/) to support its type of work. Like USDS, each PIF cohort is diverse in skillset and background, with specific recruiting for data science/AI, design, engineering, product, digital health, and digital strategy (i.e. digital advertising, entrepreneurship).

### Long term ownership

None of the three provide long-term support to specific projects; success is in partnering with agencies who can successfully manage projects at the end of an engagement like [the VA coronavirus chatbot, HRSA's telehealth.hhs.gov,](https://digital.gov/2020/10/16/product-lessons-from-the-front-lines-of-covid-19-civic-tech-response/), or the FEC's [website and campaign finance report tooling](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/05/30/the-new-fec/).

USDS and 18F maintain reference materials like [playbook.cio.gov](playbook.cio.gov) and [the TechFAR handbook](http://playbook.cio.gov/techfar/) for USDS and 18F’s [guides](https://18f.gsa.gov/guides/), all of which (along with [digital.gov](https://digital.gov/resources/)) provide best practices, case studies, and reference points that agencies have adopted in internal policies. All three offices leverage long-term products and platforms within TTS solutions, such as cloud.gov, login.gov, [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/), and [the US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). 

### Working in the open
 
USDS and PIF default to open source development (see their GitHub orgs [here](https://github.com/usds) and [here](http://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows)), but many projects are not public and/or are maintained within partner agency infrastructure (some require secret or top secret clearance). 18F has an [expansive open source policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md); you can track [most 18F work online today](https://github.com/18F)!

All of the orgs also write about their work publicly: USDS [posts on Medium](https://usdigitalservice.medium.com/), 18F [on its own blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/), and PIF [on digital.gov](https://digital.gov/topics/pif/). 18F has written extensively on many subjects and I encourage you to [search its blog](https://search.usa.gov/search/docs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=18f-site&sort_by=&dc=8925&query=devops) for authoritative commentary on many subjects.
